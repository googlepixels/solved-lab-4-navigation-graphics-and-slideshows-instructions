Upon completion of this step, upload your site to the web server and attach a copy of the zipped folder to the Dropbox.

Submit your lab to the Dropbox, located at the top of this page. For instructions on how to use the Dropbox, read these <a href="http://outboundsso.next.ecollege.com/default/launch.ed?ssoType=DVUHubSSO2&amp;node=184">step-by-step instructions</a> or watch this Tutorial <a href="http://outboundsso.next.ecollege.com/default/launch.ed?ssoType=DVUHubSSO2&amp;node=232">Dropbox Tutorial</a>.

This lab supports the following TCOs.

TCO 5—Given a Web page that requires images and advanced styles, create and edit graphics and incorporate them into the page.

TCO 10—Given a project, create a website that contains text, links, images, and any other content necessary to complete the website using HTML and External CSS.

<ol>

 <li>Obtain 10 original photos.</li>

 <li>Research on the Internet and find some code that will allow you to create a slideshow.</li>

 <li>Create a page with your photos and the code that you find.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Create a Word document showing the source for your slideshow code. Be sure to document your HTML code as well.</h2>

<h2>Lab Steps</h2>

<strong>Part A: Get Photos</strong>

<ul>

 <li>The photos can be obtained through <a href="http://quest.eb.com.proxy.devry.edu/">http://quest.eb.com.proxy.devry.edu/</a> or from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">http://commons.wikimedia.org</a>.</li>

 <li>If you have personal images that you wish to use for the assignment, be sure that you cite them correctly according to APA guidelines.</li>

 <li>All of the images that you use should be cited in the Sources document that accompanies this assignment.</li>

 <li><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Make sure that the version of each image that you use for the slideshow is less than 500K. Ten images at 500K is 5 MB, and adding the document should total no more than 7 MB.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Part B: Research Slideshow Code</strong>

Do some research on the Web to find code that will let you take your photos and build a slideshow on a page. Try to find code that is CSS based and doesn’t require a lot of JavaScript.

One example is <strong>http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/25/pure-css3-cycling-slideshow/  </strong>

<strong>Part C: Build Page and Document Sources</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Create the slideshow according to your selected research, using the images that you located in step 1.</li>

 <li>The slideshow should run automatically and should contain a text-based title for each slide.</li>

 <li>Write a description of the process that the slideshow uses to cycle through the slides and cite the source of your code.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Part D: Complete the Lab Report</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Download the CIS363 Lab Report document from Doc Sharing.</li>

 <li>The lab report must be completed for all labs. The key parts of the report include the following.</li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li style="list-style-type: none;">

  <ul>

   <li>Objectives: A one-paragraph explanation of the purpose of the lab.</li>

   <li>Results: Include a screenshot of the working website or page.</li>

   <li>Conclusions: A one-paragraph explanation of what you learned while completing the lab, any challenges you had to work through, and how you can use what you learned going forward.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

<h2>Submit Deliverables</h2>

<ol>

 <li>Copy files from the Citrix server (if necessary).</li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>Zip all of the files from Parts A, B, and C into a single zip file.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="3">

 <li>Submit your zip file to the Dropbox.</li>

</ol>
